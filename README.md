# What is Vinum?
Vinum is a declarative library that focuses on making describing relations between
different data sources easy and scalable, and most importantly, fun!

## Features
### Performance Oriented 
Vinum is designed with performance in mind, and it's API is oriented towards performance, so you will naturally find yourself writing efficient code with it.

### Type Safety
Vinum is 100% written with Luau's strict typing in consideration, and recommends the usage of strict mode when writing Vinum code.

### General Safety
Vinum code is generally safe, and and errors that often come from yielding and having nillable datasources are minimized due to strict enforcing of certain code conventions.

### Explicit Syntax
One of Vinum's core goals is explicit syntax, since such syntax allows for no confusions to happen and often allows for greater performance gains.

### Memory Management Supercharged
Vinum forces standard and *useful* manual memory tools to achieve predictability and eliminate most edge cases. 

### Dependencies Supercharged
Vinum manages dependencies for you in a very optimized and stable way so that bugs that relate to dependencies are often non-existent.
