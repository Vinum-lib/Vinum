Vinum is a blazingly fast, modern and multi-paradigm state management library. It solves the issue of data synchronization by providing a truly reactive model. 

Check out the [docs](https://plothan.github.io/Vinum/) here.

## Features
* **Multi-Paradigm** - Vinum offers state centralization and self-containment in a single interface, which allows for the maximum integration between the two. 
* **Blazing Fast** - Vinum is insanely optimized to yield incredible speed. Becuase of this, Vinum is the best of its kind for performance-critical systems.
* **Strictness and Flexibility** - Vinum is a balance of strictness and flexibility. Some limitations are present to solve greater issues, and some features are "minimal" in nature to support flexibility.
* **Declarative Syntax** - State management is dead simple- no need to manually manage dependencies!
