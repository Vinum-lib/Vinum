Vinum is an incredibly fast state management library that solves the data synchronization problem by imposing declarative and reactive data relativity. 

Check out the [docs](https://plothan.github.io/Vinum/) here.

## Features
* **Multi-Paradigm** - Vinum offers state centralization and self-containment, alongside powerful integration between the two.
* **Blazing Fast** - Vinum is insanely optimized to yield incredible speed. Becuase of this, Vinum is the best of its kind for performance-critical systems.
* **Strictness and Flexibility** - In Vinum, Processors allow for greater flexibility, however, they aren't allowed to modify the new value, therefore, allowing for strictness and predictability.
* **Declarative Syntax** - State management is dead simple- no need to manually manage dependencies!
