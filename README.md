# What is Vinum?

Vinum is a declarative library that focuses on making state management both truly reactive and scalable.

## Features

### :zap: Performance Oriented

Vinum is designed with performance in mind, and it's API is oriented towards performance, so you will naturally find yourself writing efficient code with it.

### :lock:  Type Safety
Vinum is completely written with Luau's strict type system in mind, so you can get full autocomplete and linting in your editor. Additionally, this means that Luau will be able to catch some errors before running which can decrease development time.


### :bangbang: Built-in Memory Management

Vinum forces standard and *useful* manual memory tools to achieve predictability and eliminate most (if not all!) edge cases.

### :chains: Dependencies Supercharged

Vinum manages dependencies for you in a very optimized and stable way so that bugs that relate to dependencies are often non-existent.
